/// <summary>
/// Log Table - Execution audit trail for the Test Runner API system
///
/// This table stores a chronological record of codeunit executions performed
/// via the Test Runner API, providing an audit trail for troubleshooting and monitoring.
///
/// Purpose:
/// - Track all codeunit executions with timestamped entries
/// - Record execution messages (success/failure/custom messages)
/// - Identify which server/computer performed the execution (for distributed environments)
/// - Maintain sequential entry numbering for audit purposes
///
/// Usage Pattern:
/// Log.Init();
/// Log."Message" := 'Your execution message';
/// Log."Computer Name" := ServerInstance."Server Computer Name";
/// Log.Insert();
///
/// Key Features:
/// - Auto-incrementing Entry No. ensures unique, sequential record identification
/// - No automatic deletion - maintains complete audit history
/// - Can be queried via standard BC list pages or OData endpoints
/// </summary>
